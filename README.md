# int-range

A simple Javascript utility that can generate a range of integers, from simple ranges like even and odd numbers, to multiples of a given number, all with configurable spacing between the number sequencies.

You can also easily extend the utility to generate special custom sequencies for your unique needs. E.g the sequence of leap years between 1980 and 2020!

### Why

This codebase and repository exists mostly for demonstratio and educational purposes. The goal was to show users how something like this can be built, and also walk them through the procees of building one, while highlighting the best practices we applied and decisions we made at certain stages of building out the utility. 

The free tutorial and CodeWalk is available at http://bit.ly/int-range-codewalk
